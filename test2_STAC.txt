1	intemporaliter	keyser84	Other	Figured I should check out how the interface works...	6.0
1	intemporaliter	keyser84	Other	Initially I got a message saying 'this server has no bots' (possibly paraphrased...)	7.0
1	intemporaliter	keyser84	Other	Place your first settlement?	8.0
1	keyser84	Please choose...	Other	yes, I know	9.0
1	intemporaliter	keyser84	Other	Sorry.	10.0
1	keyser84	intemporaliter	Other	but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood	11.0
1	keyser84	intemporaliter	Other	sry, I should be faster	12.0
1	intemporaliter	Please choose...	Other	No hurry :-)	13.0

Tomm: ello
Tomm: Just got a connection reset
Markus: Hm, shouldn't happen (and hasn't before). Let me know if you have problems.
Tomm: Got a SocketException error appear in this chat line
Tomm: I guess we'll see if it happens again
Markus: Yes, fingers crossed.
Tomm: I take it this is the right game to be in?
Markus: Yes, I don't know where the other two are.
Markus: It's been very last minute ...
Tomm: Excellent! Yeah, well it always feels last minute when you are getting participants, doesn't it?
Markus: Hehe, yes. Perhaps they're still in a lecture.
Tomm: So, does this generate a random Catan board?
Markus: Yes.
Tomm: I'm still rather impressed at a Hex grid in Java to be honest... Java layout always feels like a nig
Tomm: *nightmare
Markus: Indeed; I had the pleasure editing the source code of this application.
Tomm: Ah. Fun I take it? Still, it looks very nicely laid out to be honest.
Markus: Well, it's an open source projet, so it's OK. But I had to dig deeper than I wanted. :*)
Tomm: Ahh! I see. One more to go, I guess.
Markus: Yes, it's supposed to be three of you.
Markus: Hm, how are you two for time? Can we wait a bit longer?
Tomm: I'm good for a little bit longer.
rennoc1: I don't mind waiting for a while.
Markus: Great. Great. I guess if person number 3 doesn't show up in 5 or 10 minutes it'll be you only you two anywa
Markus: y.
Dave: hi
Markus: Ah, great. We can start.
Markus: Sombody has to click START GAME.
Markus: Amd and off you go!
rennoc1: so anyone else played this before?
Dave: I haven't, no
Tomm: Yes, a little... but I was never good at it.
Dave: is it still your turn rennoc?
rennoc1: yeah,
Dave: does anyone have any wood they would be willing to trade for?
Tomm: Not until people start rolling 8's :P
Dave: woo
Tomm: Bugger. Got any clay to trade for sheep/wheat?
Dave: Only got 1 and I'm holding on to it, sorry.
Tomm: Also: Rennoc - be careful holding lots of resources. If someone rolls a 7, I think, you lose cards
rennoc1: got some clay. how many do you need
Dave: Yeah, that's the robber isn'tit
Tomm: Well, what would you like for clay and/or how many do you want to give?
rennoc1: could do with some ore or sheep
Dave: While we're talking about trading, does anyone have sheep
Tomm: Yeah, on a 7 anyone with lots of cards gets halved and the robber gets moved.
Tomm: I have sheep, yes.
Dave: Need ore or wheat?
Tomm: Sheep for an ore and sheep for a clay?
Dave: sure
Tomm: soo... how do we do this?
Dave: ok, I THINK
Dave: click register a trade
Dave: then I'm not sure
Tomm: so I give a sheep to red, I get an ore, right?
Dave: yup
Tomm: Did that work?
Dave: it did, yeah
Dave: thanks
Tomm: rennoc: Sheep for an ore?
rennoc1: I dont have any ore, but i do have plenty clay
Dave: Is there a reason I can't buy a settlement now? I have the resources
Tomm: Bah, that's what I meant, sorry.
Tomm: You have to do it on your go
rennoc1: ok
Dave: yes but the road and card options have a greyed out buy option, settlement is just dashes
rennoc1: how do I accept a trade
Dave: also you tried to trade with me there tomm, not rennoc
Tomm: Thanks
rennoc1: ah...
rennoc1: thanks
Tomm: Oh, you don't have anywhere you can BUILD a settlement
Tomm: they have to be two sides away from a settlement, connected by road
Tomm: so you need to build one more segment of road first
Dave: oh, so I need to build a road first
Tomm: yeah
Dave: right, thanks
Dave: :D
Tomm: Oh... well that's unkind
Dave: sorry
Tomm: It's okay, name of the game and all that.
Tomm: Do you get a random one of my resources then?
Dave: anyone need wheat?
Dave: I did, yeah
Tomm: no thanks
Dave: rennoc?
rennoc1: i'm ok for now
Dave: aww
Tomm: well that was robbery
Dave: does the robber do anything after you put him  and before he's moved
Dave: like, if that resource comes up will you not get it or something?
Tomm: When he is in a hex you can't get resources
Dave: ah
Tomm: yeah, so 8 won't get you wheat now
Tomm: I wasn't expected to roll 7 to be honest :p
Dave: I thought you got to move the robber because you played a car?
Dave: *card
rennoc1: any got any wood they can trade
Dave: Nope
Tomm: I played the card, moved the robber and THEN rolled a 7 as well
Tomm: so I moved him twice
Dave: aah
Dave: that sucks
Tomm: and I've only got 1, and I've only got 1, sorry.
rennoc1: ok
Dave: anyone need ore?
rennoc1: yep
Dave: willing to trade for clay and sheep
Tomm: what for?
rennoc1: got some clay.
Dave: 1 ore for 1 clay?
rennoc1: ok
Tomm: Sheep!
Dave: uh
Dave: should we add time>?
Markus: Yes, sorry.
rennoc1: ADDTIME
Dave: *ADDTIME*
Tomm: Wheat? Sheep?
Tomm: Anyone needy?
Dave: I need sheep, but I have nothing to trade, possibly when my turn rolls around I'll have something
rennoc1: yeah, ive nothing either
Dave: Ok now I can trade you ore or wood, need either?
Tomm: Well looks like you have stuff now Dave :P
Tomm: Ore would be good.
Dave: 1 ore for 1 sheep it is
rennoc1: can I have some wood dave?
Dave: what have you got to trade?
rennoc1: sheep
Dave: I guess I can use two sheep
Dave: yeah, go ahead
rennoc1: i only have one sheep
Tomm: well you have no way of getting them yourself yet
Dave: true
Dave: yeah, i mean I'll still trade with tomm after this trade
Dave: wrong person
rennoc1: ...oh
Tomm: little colour ticky boxes
Tomm: Really easy to miss, I did that too.
rennoc1: cool, thanks :)
Dave: np
Dave: um
Tomm: pouty face.
Dave: Still want to trade?
Tomm: Yes, do you still want to? do you still want to?
Dave: Only chose you becasue you have three times the resources
Dave: and yeah, and yeah, sure
Dave: uuuh
Tomm: on you go then
Dave: actually, instead of sheep, do you have any wood or clay?
Tomm: Ah, 'fraid not
Dave: hmm
Tomm: Until someone rolls a 4
Dave: rennoc?
rennoc1: nope dont have either
Dave: I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, sorry
Tomm: Fair enough, thought you might!
Tomm: You did nick that sheep after all :p
Dave: well, it was revenge for earlier ^_^
Tomm: Which was revenge for you earlier. Ah, how this game goes back :p
Tomm: Just gimmie the virtual dice, hehe
Dave: I'm guessing there's no point in putting a city next to a desert
Tomm: Not unless the other hexes are very likely to come up
Dave: :/
Tomm: 7!
Dave: I've laid out my things at the start really badly
Dave: :D
Tomm: Sorry Rennoc, wanted your goods
rennoc1: aargh! my precious ores
Tomm: Delicious
Tomm: It's okay Dave, so did I.
Dave: really
Tomm: oh...
Dave: reallllly
Tomm: Oh great. Sheep. Don't have any of those.
Dave: that was my favourite sheep!
Tomm: Worrying... >.>
Tomm: Sorry, what did you roll Rennoc?
rennoc1: a 5 ( I think)
Tomm: ORE! :D
Tomm: Also... you're all gonna hate me
Dave: oh no
Dave: well, that wasn't too bad well, that wasn't too bad
rennoc1: oh dear...
Tomm: Sorry, need me some clay and I can't get it
Dave: wheat for ore anyone?
Tomm: You just nicked my wheat :P
Tomm: Not going to buy it back
Dave: Want to buy it back? :D
Dave: aw
Dave: discard?
Tomm: Well that was upsetting.
Dave: did you just lose four resources?
Tomm: yes
Dave: how?
rennoc1: rolled a 7
Tomm: Had too many cards when a 7 came up
Dave: yeah, but
Dave: oh
Dave: didn't know that was a thing
Tomm: I think it's over 7?
Tomm: Anyway. Bah.
Tomm: My wheat!
Dave: I didn't want that wheat anyway
Tomm: Anyone want anything for wood?
Tomm: seeing as no one is rolling 8's despite it being really likely.
Dave: equally likely for all numbers? Although I guess it depends on how the rolls are simulated
rennoc1: dont have any, sorry
Tomm: Nah it isn't if it follows the proper game.
Tomm: You are rolling 2 dice... so there are more ways of rolling say an 8, rather than a 2
Dave: Yeah, I mean if it's actually rolling two dice then there are more 8's tha- well, yeha
Tomm: So no wood anyone? okay okay
Dave: nope, sorry
Dave: 10 10 10
Dave: never a 10
Dave: :9
Dave: *:(
Tomm: Yeah. Also 8 should be as likely as a 6... but looads of 6's no 8's :p
Dave: also 7's, we've had about half the rolls as sevens
Tomm: 7 is the most likely to be fair
Tomm: from what I remember
Dave: it is, yeah, even so
rennoc1: so anyone have any ore? I have sheep to spare
Dave: I have wheat
Tomm: fraid not
Dave: more wheat, great
Dave: anyone need wheat?
Tomm: Really not, sorry.
Dave: rennoc?
rennoc1: I'm fine for wheat at the mo
Tomm: well... sigh.
Dave: least you didn't have to lose half your resrouces this time
Tomm: true.
Tomm: I'd rather like to roll an 8 though :P
Dave: No more wheat!
Tomm: Well thank you Rennoc :D
Dave: anyone need wheat?
Tomm: What for?
Dave: clay, I guess, or ore
Dave: or wood
rennoc1: you know if you have more than 4, I think you can trade them into the bank,
Dave: yeah but it's not ideal
Tomm: That's true... 4 -> 1
Tomm: Well, I might do, but depends on my roll, I'm afraid
Tomm: Dave: Wheat for a clay?
Dave: sure, can you do 2 for 2, or do you just want 1 for 1
Tomm: Just 1-4-1 I'm afraid
Dave: fair enough
Tomm: Oh... now I get wheat(!)
Dave: heh
rennoc1: any spare ores anyone?
Dave: afraid not, sorry
Tomm: None here either :(
Dave: wheat for wood anyone?
Dave: or a sheep
Tomm: sorry :/
Dave: how do those resource tiles in the water work
Tomm: If you have a settlement on them you can get better trades
Dave: I thought that was the number ones
Tomm: the 3:1 means you can trade 3 of anything to 1 of anything
Dave: what about the other ones
Tomm: The resource ones -I think- mean you can trade 2 of any of that item to 1 of anything else
Dave: ah, that's pretty good
Tomm: But I might have that the wrong way around
rennoc1: anyone have any wood?
Dave: nope, sorry
Tomm: I think we are all looking for it! I think we are all looking for it!
Tomm: Oh.
Dave: can anyone trade clay for ore
Dave: as in, I give you the clay
Tomm: No ore, sorry.
rennoc1: me neither me neither
Dave: good roll that
Dave: thanks
Tomm: Sorry, boss walked in
Dave: np
Tomm: Yes, that was a good roll for you.
Tomm: Ah. Sheep.
Dave: You basically control the sheep
Tomm: That's not as handy or as sinister as it sounds
Tomm: Unfortunately.
Dave: Still cooler than being a wheat baron
Tomm: I don't know, you've got 'baron' right there in the title
Dave: That is actually the only good thing about this job
Tomm: Thank god. I was going to scream if I rolled a 7
Dave: haha
Tomm: Woo! Clay! Hard-earned clay!
Dave: anyone got clay or ore they can swap for wheat?
Dave: clay or wood, rather
Tomm: Only got that one
Dave: could you, by any chance, use some fine high quality wheat
Dave: guaranteed to be 100% more edible than clay
Tomm: If I get more clay, perhaps... I can eat the sheep for now.
Tomm: Cook them in my lovely new tandoor oven I made out of the clay!
rennoc1: maybe but I have almost nothing but wheat to trade back
Dave: clay or wood rennoc?
Dave: either one
rennoc1: unfortunately, neither one
rennoc1: tomm, could I give you 3 sheep for a clay and an ore?
Tomm: I don't have ore, I'm afraid!
Tomm: Plus... I'm basically rolling in sheep
Tomm: Really need to move that robber blocking your clay, eh? :/
rennoc1: but if I gave you some sheep, you could trade them back for the resources you'd need
Tomm: Well, as I say, don't have any ore at all
rennoc1: ok, cool.
Tomm: I think Dave is the only one who does
Tomm: *whispers*horder!
rennoc1: do you have any ores, dave?
Dave: lo
Dave: I don't, no
Dave: I have wheat
Dave: wheat
Dave: I stole your wheat
Dave: aand, I didn't mean to end that
Tomm: Wait, who'd you steam from?
Dave: rennoc
Dave: wwait
rennoc1: so i see. i am now utterly wheatless
Dave: maybe you?
Tomm: Oh, that's harsh.
Tomm: one sec
Dave: nah, it was rennoc
Dave: hey, I know where you can get some good wheat
Dave: but seriously, want to trade for some wheat?
Tomm: where goes the robber?
Dave: hasn't been moved yet
Tomm: bah, phone, brb.
Tomm: Hey!
Tomm: :p
Dave: heh
Dave: ...
Dave: noooo
Dave: I just bought the wrong resource
rennoc1: so you have ore to spare then...?
Dave: I do
Dave: ore for wood?
rennoc1: if only... I have clay? I have clay?
Dave: that is more useful
Dave: yeah, go ahead yeah, go ahead
Tomm: Sorry, back
Tomm: what did I miss?
Dave: not much
Dave: ADDTIME
Dave: we play this to the end, not until the time runs out, yeah?
Tomm: yeah, we'll see
Tomm: Right, anyway... so I have bugger all... annnnd... yes.
rennoc1: so dave, what did you have to trade for clay?
Tomm: I covert rennoc's clay.
Tomm: I could offer things?
Dave: wood?
Tomm: Ore?
Dave: clay rennoc
Dave: I have ore to trade (or wheat, always wheat) I have ore to trade (or wheat, always wheat)
rennoc1: tomm, do you have ore?
Tomm: Yes, yes I do
rennoc1: ok
Tomm: 8!
Tomm: 8!
Tomm: Not 8.
Dave: any wood around?
rennoc1: nope
Tomm: Damn robber. He stole my sheep
Tomm: Woo! Poor!
Dave: has anyone got a sheep, I can trade wheat or clay
Tomm: Surprisingly I am bereft of sheep.
Dave: :(
Dave: rennoc?
rennoc1: sorry, no sheep
rennoc1: brb
Tomm: Fancy some tasty ore?
Dave: I do not ^_^
Tomm: But... you can... you know... smelt it?
Tomm: How about clay?
Dave: nope, sorry, I'm good for clay
Tomm: For... you know... sculpture?
Dave: and pots
Tomm: Bah. Philistine :P
Dave: hey, the people of Davetopia make very nice pots
Dave: ooh, wood
Dave: trade?
rennoc1: ok im back
Tomm: Oh, so now Davetopia makes with the niceties?
Dave: we are a fickle people
Tomm: Where was all this decorum when we talked before?
Dave: well you didn't have wood then
Tomm: Snigger.
Tomm: Tommville is amused by such base humour. Anyway, what will you offer for wood?
Dave: wheat?:D
Dave: or clay
rennoc1: anone have sheep
Tomm: Pfft, your pots are of no use.
Tomm: Sadly still no sheep :(
Dave: wheat then?
Tomm: Talk to rennoc first, it's his go :p
rennoc1: yeah sure, could do with some wheat yeah sure, could do with some wheat
Dave: got wood?
Tomm: Still snigger.
rennoc1: nope
Dave: heh
Dave: that's all I'm interested in, sorry :(
Tomm: Dave - how many wheat would you give for 1 wood?
Dave: I will give you one whole wheat
Tomm: I must demand 2.
rennoc1: i would give you 2 clay?
Tomm: For the good of my people you understand
Dave: I must refuse, on principle
Dave: well, it depends
Dave: we'll see
Tomm: Rennoc, full of clay I'm afraid.
Tomm: although I could offer you ore, Rennoc?
Tomm: depending on what you have
Dave: also if anyone rolls a seven I will never forgive them
rennoc1: well... I've got some really good quality clay.
Tomm: Ah... we'll see when we get around to me, can bid for the wood.
Tomm: You crafty gender non-specific pronoun!
Dave: I can give you one wheat and ore for wood
Tomm: Don't want ore.
Tomm: Rennoc what can you offer me for wood?
rennoc1: how about 4 clay for 1 wood and 1 ore?
Dave: don't do it! it's a trap
Tomm: Wow, you are clay tastic, eh?
rennoc1: yep, I speak to you from a bath of clay!
Dave: (make sure it's not the bath clay he gives you) (make sure it's not the bath clay he gives you)
Tomm: eww. Fair point. Fresh clay if you please
Tomm: Dave... wood for a wheat?
rennoc1: my bath has been demoted to a sink
Dave: sure
Dave: wrong player
Tomm: bah
Dave: thanks
Tomm: No... thank you all!
Tomm: Tommville is now Tommopolis!
Dave: :O
Tomm: Wow, nice roll Rennoc :D
Dave: ok, rennoc, listen to me
Dave: don't give tomm wheat
Dave: sorry tomm
Dave: but he can win the game if he gets wheat
Tomm: Aww. :(
rennoc1: can you give wheat to me, dave?
Tomm: Sadly, the man does have a point. Sadly, the man does have a point.
Dave: uh, I might get some on my turn, so maybe
rennoc1: for clay?
Dave: I'm good for clay, thanks
rennoc1: any one have sheep?
Tomm: That's a fair point, I've not had sheep for ages. I've not had sheep for ages.
Dave: 3 sheep
Dave: really
Tomm: Rennoc... I have sheep now?
Tomm: Got any wheat? :P
Dave: nooooooo
Dave: don't give him wheat, also, if you get the robber put it on that wheat tile in the middle
rennoc1: nope sorry. I could spare some clay though
Tomm: 1 clay for 1 sheep?
rennoc1: thanks
Tomm: muhaha!
Dave: uh no
rennoc1: we're doomed
Dave: that got you less points than I thought
Tomm: Settlement is worth 2, city 3
Dave: anyone got wood or sheep to trade?
rennoc1: well, I am going to have to go in 5-10 mins, so before I do does anyone want any of my resources
Dave: you have to go?
Tomm: I'm confused... I think I should have won?
rennoc1: unfortunately, yes.
Dave: I'll add time shall I? We can always end it when we want anyway
rennoc1: if we dont add time i could play till then though!
rennoc1: or that.
Dave: do you have any wood or sheep rennoc?
rennoc1: both
Dave: 1 ore and 1 wheat for 1 wood and 1 sheep? 1 ore and 1 wheat for 1 wood and 1 sheep?
rennoc1: how about this.
Dave: addtime
Dave: don't have 2 wheat
rennoc1: oh
Dave: would have offered it otherwise
Tomm: bugger, I can't add up, that's why.
Dave: heh
Tomm: ?
Dave: rennoc, you there?
rennoc1: I really need to head off, what do you need guys? i have 5 clay, 1 ore, 2 sheep, 1 wood.
Dave: sheep, wood
rennoc1: sorry for cutting things short on my part
rennoc1: how about you tomm?
Tomm: Feel free to fire me the clay
rennoc1: ok it turns out you have to give me something in a trade
Dave: a clay?
rennoc1: have anything you can spare for the trade tomm?
Tomm: not realy, just ditch it
rennoc1: ok , thanks guys and good luck!
Tomm: cheers, was good playing!
Dave: so what happens if he quits?
Dave: will the game remove him?
Markus: You two just continue
Tomm: press done on his go :P
Tomm: lets finish this up!
Tomm: SHEEP!
Dave: null needs to discard?
Dave: I'm guessing that's rennoc
Tomm: Oh... I can't move the robber?
Dave: you've moved it already?
Tomm: No, that was for a soldier card
Dave: oh
Dave: it says null needs to discard, I think it's a bug
Dave: it's still counting rennoc as having over 7 resources
Markus: Does it work now?
Tomm: yes, fixed
Dave: wwwhat
Dave: oh, right
Dave: ^_^
Tomm: Woo! Settlement!
Dave: ha, congrats
Dave: good game
Tomm: Hehe, it was fun, thanks.
Tomm: I think I got very lucky getting to the sheep port
Dave: I spent far too long at the start building pointless roads, I wasn't 100% sure where I could build s
Tomm: 24 sheep :o
Dave: haha
Tomm: Yeah, that is a problem... Rennoc had lost about half way through to be honest
Tomm: I sort of cut him out >.>
Tomm: and ore is more important in the later game too
Dave: Yeah, I noticed, he couldn't really expand
Dave: I had just managed to take a wheat port, which would have been very helpful
Tomm: Yes!
Tomm: Ports are great if you get them
Tomm: Anyway, was a pleasure, should do it again sometime, outside of the experiment!
Markus: Thanks for participating.
Dave: Yeah, it's a good game
Markus: Glad you enjoyed it.
Markus: Please take a minute to fill in the questionnaire.
Dave: No problem, I'll send in the questionare in 10 minutes
Tomm: I'll get you your questionaire back tomorrow if that is okay, Markus, have to go myself
Markus: Also, for your £5 you'll have to come by my office.
Markus: Unfortunately.
Dave: sure, where is your office? where is your office?
Markus: Informatics Forum 3.24.
Markus: I'll be in and out tomorrow but should be there most of Wednesday.
Tomm: If you were to email me the form, could I send a surrogate with my signed form?
Dave: I have most of wednesday off, so I'll come in then, any particular time you'd prefer? any particular time you'd prefer?
Tomm: Have a friend who works there
Markus: Hm, I guess you could scan it in an send it back.
Markus: Or send it by post.
Markus: Sorry it's the necessary paper trail ...
Markus: I'll send you the form.
Tomm: It's okay, I understand
Markus: I've no preference for Wednesday
Markus: Should be there most of the day.
Tomm: Cheers if you email me the form now, I'll give it to my friend tonight, I'm heading to see him.
Markus: Already working on it.

Tomm: Perfect, thanks Markus. I'll email you my response tomorrow
Markus: OK, that's good for me.
Markus: Wed @ 2 or so; good.

gotwood4sheep: I haven't played but know its addictive nature from my friends
ljaybrad123: if he doesn't turn up then the final game is the decider.;;;
gotwood4sheep: i guess, unless we have time to reschedule the tomas game before 27th?

ljaybrad123: could have played earlier because Im off work :(
gotwood4sheep: d'oh :(
ljaybrad123: I fell at work yesterday
ljaybrad123: so off for the rest of the week
ljaybrad123: sadly unpaid :(
gotwood4sheep: um...sorry to hear it... but if you fell at work shouldn't they be paying, or at least bracing themse
gotwood4sheep: lves for a claim?  what kind of fall?
gotwood4sheep: you shouldn't lose pay if it was work-related :/
ljaybrad123: erm... im technically self employed...
gotwood4sheep: oh ouch oh ouch
gotwood4sheep: :( :(
ljaybrad123: and they should be... they made me wear slippy overshoes. they made me wear slippy overshoes.
ljaybrad123: we'll see what happens
gotwood4sheep: sounds like a liability case to be contested.  good luck
gotwood4sheep: are you ok? just sore?
gotwood4sheep: or is it possibly worse?
gotwood4sheep: sorry, don't want to sound prying :P
ljaybrad123: it does - but I don't really know what to do...
gotwood4sheep: there's always no win no fee people
gotwood4sheep: did they file an accident report? did they file an accident report?
ljaybrad123: erm bad bruising - muscle damge -
gotwood4sheep: ouch :(
gotwood4sheep: sorry, guess whose dad worked in insurance :P
ljaybrad123: yeah im tempted
ljaybrad123: lol I don't blame you/....
ljaybrad123: I'm very tempted because its incredibly sore
gotwood4sheep: I'd take some pictures and make sure a report is filed so you have something to work with
gotwood4sheep: if you don't deal with the evidence now it'll be tough
ljaybrad123: I can't take pictures....
gotwood4sheep: and if you're self employed you've gotta protect your income
gotwood4sheep: the report and/or questions of liability are most important
gotwood4sheep: maybe a trip to the doctors as well in that case
gotwood4sheep: ?
ljaybrad123: yeah I went to docs
gotwood4sheep: well at least that's on file.
gotwood4sheep: I'd send the workplace a message checking they've filed an accident report
gotwood4sheep: and saying you're considering your options
ljaybrad123: bad bruising but pretty sure it's not broken
gotwood4sheep: at least you give them notice
gotwood4sheep: hope so :( hope so :(
ljaybrad123: I told them i needed a report yesterday
gotwood4sheep: good.  well, good luck.
gotwood4sheep: it sucks and it's stressful, and doing it when you feel bad blows
ljaybrad123: thanks
gotwood4sheep: but it's one of those things you have to move on, sadly
gotwood4sheep: and i do, of course, hope you feel better soon
gotwood4sheep: so you don't miss out too much
ljaybrad123: yeah I just feel naff - and now cant work today or tomorrow at least
gotwood4sheep: :(
ljaybrad123: maybe longer...
ljaybrad123: I can't lift any of the kids atm so i cant work
gotwood4sheep: I'd definitely cost up lost earnings and try and get a settlement
ljaybrad123: yeah - it's just kinda like is it worth all the hassle for £70
gotwood4sheep: /incidental settlers pun
ljaybrad123: :)
gotwood4sheep: You might find they're sweating it and if you asked for £70 they'd say sure
gotwood4sheep: settling works for all
ljaybrad123: hmmm
ljaybrad123: I get the distinct feeling they dont really care
gotwood4sheep: they'll care more if they think you're pursuing legal action
gotwood4sheep: if they really don't, default judgement, bang
ljaybrad123: yeah I suppose yeah I suppose
gotwood4sheep: I'd suggest a price, if they don't respond, small claims and see
gotwood4sheep: sounds like there's a case to be heard
ljaybrad123: hmmm fair point
gotwood4sheep: if he's not here in 7 mins we'll not have time before william arrives
gotwood4sheep: sigh...

inca: heh that's not too weird really, music's taken a bad turn recently
Gaeilgeoir: very true
inca: i'm sort of a classical musician, but i respect popular music from the time in which it was actually
inca: *actually musical
Gaeilgeoir: What do you play? I play some piano
inca: cool, i play trumpet
inca: and piano very poorly
inca: what level are you?
Gaeilgeoir: quite mediocre. Grade 5 or 6.
Gaeilgeoir: I enjoy it though
Gaeilgeoir: Trumpet sounds great though.

Gaeilgeoir: sweet. any chance that's on youtube? any chance that's on youtube?
inca: can't find it sadly
inca: i mostly like late romantic /20th century composers, my favourite is shostakovich
inca: how about you?
Gaeilgeoir: Most German/Austrian composers from the 18th/19th centuries.
Gaeilgeoir: I particularly like Wagner and Bach.
Gaeilgeoir: Rachmaninov also has some beautiful piano works
Gaeilgeoir: And Sibelius. I like him too. There are too many. :P
inca: haha nice, yeah wagner's awesome
inca: particularly for a brass player
Gaeilgeoir: yep.
Gaeilgeoir: I don't know if you know John Field. He was an Irish composer so I'm quite proud of him too. Some gr
Gaeilgeoir: Some great piano work
inca: ah, no i haven't heard of him
Gaeilgeoir: doesn't look like Kieran's coming
inca: indeed, that's a problem
Gaeilgeoir: any response from him at all?
inca: i'll send an e-mail just on the off-chance he's online but forgotten
inca: he definitely said he could play before
inca: if we can't do it tonight, our last hope really is that we can play it on wednesday
inca: if we're allowed to
Gaeilgeoir: unfortunately, I won't be able.
inca: ah
Gaeilgeoir: But if you want to do so, please go ahead. As I said, I don't mind at this stage
inca: well it would be a shame to exclude you, since you showed up today and all
Gaeilgeoir: ah god, I'd be online anyway, trust me.
inca: to be honest i think the fairest thing would be for us to play it now without him
Gaeilgeoir: I have six windows open at once here
Gaeilgeoir: well, we can start.
Gaeilgeoir: if he comes, we can restart.
inca: yep, that sounds fair yep, that sounds fair

zorburt: yeah i don't have the real life cues to stop me.
raefbrisbin: shouldn't trade with me

raefbrisbin: ya, resulted in a lot of 1:1 trading
raefbrisbin: let's hope he didn't get a knight or its over
zorburt: and that gramos managed to build the highway to hell with no one stopping him.
gramos: yeah, but then the dice turned on me...

gramos: I have time, sorry. I was making a joke that there's no way for ME to win.
zorburt: ADDTIME
raefbrisbin: why would you robber just my ore when someone has 9?
gramos: it's the principle of it, I'll guess
raefbrisbin: okey dokey
gramos: when in doubt, build a road
raefbrisbin: I think your road is safe
gramos: hey, anyone need sheep?
gramos: I could use some wood
zorburt: no

gotwood4sheep: hex*
CheshireCatGrin: still no-one wants wheat ... ?
gotwood4sheep: i can offer wood?
dmm: nope
gotwood4sheep: i seem to be woody
gotwood4sheep: oh or a sheep
gotwood4sheep: matt, wood or sheep for wheat?
dmm: bah, having only 4 options for picking up resources is tough
CheshireCatGrin: i'd like a wood
gotwood4sheep: deal!
gotwood4sheep: ah 8
gotwood4sheep: my lost friend
dmm: a more complex offer this time: i'll give an ore and a wheat for a clay and a wood
gotwood4sheep: i have no clay
gotwood4sheep: so your complexity is lost on me :)
CheshireCatGrin: i can't give away either
dmm: sigh :( sigh :(

gotwood4sheep: no 10 to date
dmm: wow wow
dmm: i'm feeling rather behind now...
dmm: 8s and 9s aren't as common as i'd hoped!
gotwood4sheep: 10s are not plentiful
gotwood4sheep: 8s have been common as they get
gotwood4sheep: booo
gotwood4sheep: i stole from the wrong guy ;)
dmm: any clay?

gotwood4sheep: need to see a T
CheshireCatGrin: likewise likewise
gotwood4sheep: then i'll let you know you can rob me
dmm: hmm i don't think there's anything else i can use right now... oh well
dmm: ooh i'm a bit scared of those 2 soldiers+2 dev cards
gotwood4sheep: there goes 1
gotwood4sheep: needed to thieve
dmm: aha so there wasn't a soldier among them ;) aha so there wasn't a soldier among them ;)
dmm: i haven't been paying attention... any tens yet?
gotwood4sheep: still not one
gotwood4sheep: how many rolls, 30?
dmm: okey doke
gotwood4sheep: maybe 24?
gotwood4sheep: ludicrous
dmm: for some reason i often find 10s are much rarer than they should be
gotwood4sheep: as rare as 4s ;)
dmm: that's how it should be! but 4s always seem to come up more often in my experience but 4s always seem to come up more often in my experience
gotwood4sheep: they have this game :D
dmm: why can't real life obey the rules of maths
gotwood4sheep: our sample size is small ;)

dmm: 5s weren't so lucky for me :'(
gotwood4sheep: jammy really
gotwood4sheep: so that game: no 10s
gotwood4sheep: at all
gotwood4sheep: that's one for the statisticians

gotwood4sheep: ta :D
inca: heh i did have a read through it, wonder if that helped
gotwood4sheep: good blog, interesting
inca: was surprised at some of the relative values of resources
gotwood4sheep: this game has some hidden complexity
gotwood4sheep: indeed yes
inca: i always saw clay as vital but they rate it as the least vital
gotwood4sheep: so it is
gotwood4sheep: the longest road is easiest to compete
gotwood4sheep: and settlements lose value
gotwood4sheep: ore/wheat ftw
gotwood4sheep: I underrated sheep for a while
gotwood4sheep: but they are great for card wins
gotwood4sheep: I must rush and walk the dog, we should chat more soon! Hopefully another season is round the corne
gotwood4sheep: corner*
inca: ok, was nice 'meeting' you!
inca: hoepfully see you again nex time
gotwood4sheep: indeed, you too!
inca: see you later :)
inca: x
intemporaliter: Hello?
keyser84: hi
keyser84: i actually tried to figure out how to add AI players to the game....
intemporaliter: Figured I should check out how the interface works...
intemporaliter: Initially I got a message saying 'this server has no bots' (possibly paraphrased...)
intemporaliter: Place your first settlement?
keyser84: yes, I know
intemporaliter: Sorry.
keyser84: but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood
keyser84: sry, I should be faster
intemporaliter: No hurry :-)
keyser84: ok, now vice versa, so me again
intemporaliter: Aye.
intemporaliter: Possibly not my greatest ever play, but my other choice was between your two settlements .
keyser84: yes, so now who rolls the dice?
intemporaliter: It seems to have rolled for me (or at least, I didn't get the option to hit 'roll'...
keyser84: yes, game log says it... displays only 2 lines of text in my case
intemporaliter: Yup. Same. Didn't notice at first.
intemporaliter: Are you at all interested in trading a sheep for a brick (if you have one)?
keyser84: no, have no brick
intemporaliter: Fair, I wasn't sure.
keyser84: ok, so trade is my only option
intemporaliter: That must be how it shows robber movement.
keyser84: yes, that was my point
keyser84: i meant for wood
keyser84: ok, but wait, why there is a contour robber on wood-2
intemporaliter: I don't know, bug? bug?
keyser84: and the grey one on clay-9
keyser84: hmmm
intemporaliter: I moved it there with the 7, then onto the brick with a soldier...
keyser84: anyway, then i have at least the low possibility of getting wood
keyser84: ah, I see
intemporaliter: I was nicer that time - nothing is totally blocked now.
intemporaliter: looks like it shows you a shadow of the last placing of the robber...
keyser84: yes
intemporaliter: It would be nice to be able to buy something other than development cards...
keyser84: ok
keyser84: want to trade? I give 1 wheat, you give 1 sheep
intemporaliter: If you get any clay, I will happily trade. Don't currently need wheat though.
keyser84: no, then not then not
keyser84: i give 2 wheat, you give 1 sheep?
intemporaliter: Okay
keyser84: again 2 wheat for 1 sheep?
intemporaliter: I'm out of sheep, I'm afraid - swapped them for clay.
keyser84: ah, ok
intemporaliter: Don't suppose you'd be interested in ore for clay?
keyser84: ok, why not
intemporaliter: Thank you.
keyser84: you can give sheep for wheat?
intemporaliter: Is your points counter showing you 4 or 6? Yours is showing me 4, but you should have longest road?
intemporaliter: I wish I had sheep. Need to roll a 4!
keyser84: 4 points, longest road i think only from 5 roads or longer
keyser84: as far as i remember the rules
intemporaliter: Sounds right now. Was getting mixed up with army, which is only 3.
keyser84: ah, yes
keyser84: i was lucky to get directly the 7
keyser84: ok, 3 times 7 in a row
intemporaliter: As was I. Odd steak...
intemporaliter: /streak
keyser84: trade? i give 1 ore, receive 1 wood/wheat
intemporaliter: I'll give you a wood for 2 ore?
keyser84: ok
keyser84: trade? i give 2 ore, receive 2 wheat
intemporaliter: Okay
intemporaliter: Apologies for the delay. Employment agency call. Back now.
keyser84: no problem
intemporaliter: Do you have any spare wheat? I've ore or sheep on offer.
keyser84: ok, 1 wheat for 1 sheep
intemporaliter: Ok
keyser84: i give 2 ore for 1 clay/wheat
keyser84: ok?
intemporaliter: I have no clay or wheat, I'm afraid :-(
keyser84: ok
intemporaliter: If the robber were to leave my clay :-) If the robber were to leave my clay :-)
keyser84: sry, has to go there :-)
intemporaliter: Do you have any wheat or sheep for ore or wood?
keyser84: can you give 2 wood for 1 sheep
intemporaliter: Would give 3 wood for a sheep and a wheat?
keyser84: sry, have no wheat
intemporaliter: Okay, will do 2 wood for a sheep.
keyser84: ok, fine
keyser84: congrats!
intemporaliter: Thank you. I got just the right development card there. I got just the right development card there.
keyser84: quite nice, but the interface could be better
intemporaliter: Odd playing this two player. Happier with the interface now though.
keyser84: yes
keyser84: ok, i'll leave then
keyser84: cu
intemporaliter: Bye!

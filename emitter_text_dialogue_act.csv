Other,Tomm,ello
Other,Markus,Just got a connection reset
Other,Tomm,"Hm, shouldn't happen (and hasn't before). Let me know if you have problems."
Other,Tomm,Got a SocketException error appear in this chat line
Other,Markus,I guess we'll see if it happens again
Other,Tomm,"Yes, fingers crossed."
Other,Markus,I take it this is the right game to be in?
Other,Markus,"Yes, I don't know where the other two are."
Other,Tomm,It's been very last minute ...
Other,Markus,"Excellent! Yeah, well it always feels last minute when you are getting participants, doesn't it?"
Other,Tomm,"Hehe, yes. Perhaps they're still in a lecture."
Other,Markus,"So, does this generate a random Catan board?"
Other,Tomm,Yes.
Other,Tomm,I'm still rather impressed at a Hex grid in Java to be honest... Java layout always feels like a nig
Other,Markus,*nightmare
Other,Tomm,Indeed; I had the pleasure editing the source code of this application.
Other,Markus,"Ah. Fun I take it? Still, it looks very nicely laid out to be honest."
Other,Tomm,"Well, it's an open source projet, so it's OK. But I had to dig deeper than I wanted. :*)"
Other,Markus,"Ahh! I see. One more to go, I guess."
Other,Markus,"Yes, it's supposed to be three of you."
Other,Tomm,"Hm, how are you two for time? Can we wait a bit longer?"
Other,rennoc1,I'm good for a little bit longer.
Other,Markus,I don't mind waiting for a while.
Other,Markus,Great. Great. I guess if person number 3 doesn't show up in 5 or 10 minutes it'll be you only you two anywa
Other,Dave,y.
Other,Markus,hi
Other,Markus,"Ah, great. We can start."
Other,Markus,Sombody has to click START GAME.
Other,rennoc1,Amd and off you go!
Other,Dave,so anyone else played this before?
Other,Tomm,"I haven't, no"
Other,Dave,"Yes, a little... but I was never good at it."
Other,rennoc1,is it still your turn rennoc?
Other,Dave,"yeah,"
Offer,Tomm,does anyone have any wood they would be willing to trade for?
"Refusal, Other",Dave,Not until people start rolling 8's :P
Other,Tomm,woo
"Offer, Other",Dave,Bugger. Got any clay to trade for sheep/wheat?
"Refusal, Other",Tomm,"Only got 1 and I'm holding on to it, sorry."
Other,rennoc1,"Also: Rennoc - be careful holding lots of resources. If someone rolls a 7, I think, you lose cards"
Accept,Dave,got some clay. how many do you need
Other,Tomm,"Yeah, that's the robber isn'tit"
Offer,rennoc1,"Well, what would you like for clay and/or how many do you want to give?"
Counteroffer,Dave,could do with some ore or sheep
"Counteroffer, Other",Tomm,"While we're talking about trading, does anyone have sheep"
Other,Tomm,"Yeah, on a 7 anyone with lots of cards gets halved and the robber gets moved."
Accept,Dave,"I have sheep, yes."
Counteroffer,Tomm,Need ore or wheat?
Offer,Dave,Sheep for an ore and sheep for a clay?
Accept,Tomm,sure
Other,Dave,soo... how do we do this?
Other,Dave,"ok, I THINK"
Other,Dave,click register a trade
Other,Tomm,then I'm not sure
Other,Dave,"so I give a sheep to red, I get an ore, right?"
Other,Tomm,yup
Other,Dave,Did that work?
Other,Dave,"it did, yeah"
Other,Tomm,thanks
Offer,rennoc1,rennoc: Sheep for an ore?
"Counteroffer, Refusal",Dave,"I dont have any ore, but i do have plenty clay"
Other,Tomm,Is there a reason I can't buy a settlement now? I have the resources
Other,Tomm,"Bah, that's what I meant, sorry."
Other,rennoc1,You have to do it on your go
Other,Dave,ok
Other,rennoc1,"yes but the road and card options have a greyed out buy option, settlement is just dashes"
Other,Dave,how do I accept a trade
Other,Tomm,"also you tried to trade with me there tomm, not rennoc"
Other,rennoc1,Thanks
Other,rennoc1,ah...
Other,Tomm,thanks
Other,Tomm,"Oh, you don't have anywhere you can BUILD a settlement"
Other,Tomm,"they have to be two sides away from a settlement, connected by road"
Other,Dave,so you need to build one more segment of road first
Other,Tomm,"oh, so I need to build a road first"
Other,Dave,yeah
Other,Dave,"right, thanks"
Other,Tomm,:D
Other,Dave,Oh... well that's unkind
Other,Tomm,sorry
Other,Tomm,"It's okay, name of the game and all that."
Other,Dave,Do you get a random one of my resources then?
Offer,Dave,anyone need wheat?
Other,Tomm,"I did, yeah"
Refusal,Dave,no thanks
Offer,rennoc1,rennoc?
Refusal,Dave,i'm ok for now
Other,Tomm,aww
Other,Dave,well that was robbery
Other,Dave,does the robber do anything after you put him  and before he's moved
Other,Tomm,"like, if that resource comes up will you not get it or something?"
Other,Dave,When he is in a hex you can't get resources
Other,Tomm,ah
Other,Tomm,"yeah, so 8 won't get you wheat now"
Other,Dave,I wasn't expected to roll 7 to be honest :p
Other,Dave,I thought you got to move the robber because you played a car?
Other,rennoc1,*card
Offer,Dave,any got any wood they can trade
Refusal,Tomm,Nope
Other,Tomm,"I played the card, moved the robber and THEN rolled a 7 as well"
Other,Dave,so I moved him twice
Other,Dave,aah
Other,Tomm,that sucks
"Refusal, Other",rennoc1,"and I've only got 1, and I've only got 1, sorry."
Other,Dave,ok
Offer,rennoc1,anyone need ore?
Accept,Dave,yep
Offer,Tomm,willing to trade for clay and sheep
Counteroffer,rennoc1,what for?
Accept,Dave,got some clay.
Offer,rennoc1,1 ore for 1 clay?
Accept,Tomm,ok
Offer,Dave,Sheep!
Other,Dave,uh
Other,Markus,should we add time>?
Other,rennoc1,"Yes, sorry."
Other,Dave,ADDTIME
Other,Tomm,*ADDTIME*
Offer,Tomm,Wheat? Sheep?
Offer,Dave,Anyone needy?
"Refusal, Other",rennoc1,"I need sheep, but I have nothing to trade, possibly when my turn rolls around I'll have something"
"Refusal, Other",Dave,"yeah, ive nothing either"
"Offer, Other",Tomm,"Ok now I can trade you ore or wood, need either?"
Other,Tomm,Well looks like you have stuff now Dave :P
Accept,Dave,Ore would be good.
Offer,rennoc1,1 ore for 1 sheep it is
Counteroffer,Dave,can I have some wood dave?
Counteroffer,rennoc1,what have you got to trade?
Counteroffer,Dave,sheep
Accept,Dave,I guess I can use two sheep
"Accept, Other",rennoc1,"yeah, go ahead"
Other,Tomm,i only have one sheep
Other,Dave,well you have no way of getting them yourself yet
Other,Dave,true
Other,Dave,"yeah, i mean I'll still trade with tomm after this trade"
Other,rennoc1,wrong person
Other,Tomm,...oh
Other,Tomm,little colour ticky boxes
Other,rennoc1,"Really easy to miss, I did that too."
Other,Dave,"cool, thanks :)"
Other,Dave,np
Other,Tomm,um
Other,Dave,pouty face.
Offer,Tomm,Still want to trade?
Accept,Dave,"Yes, do you still want to? do you still want to?"
Other,Dave,Only chose you becasue you have three times the resources
Accept,Dave,"and yeah, and yeah, sure"
Other,Tomm,uuuh
Other,Dave,on you go then
Offer,Tomm,"actually, instead of sheep, do you have any wood or clay?"
Refusal,Dave,"Ah, 'fraid not"
Other,Tomm,hmm
Other,Dave,Until someone rolls a 4
Offer,rennoc1,rennoc?
Refusal,Dave,nope dont have either
Other,Tomm,"I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, I'm actually going to hold off on the trade for now, sorry"
Other,Tomm,"Fair enough, thought you might!"
Other,Dave,You did nick that sheep after all :p
Other,Tomm,"well, it was revenge for earlier ^_^"
Other,Tomm,"Which was revenge for you earlier. Ah, how this game goes back :p"
Other,Dave,"Just gimmie the virtual dice, hehe"
Other,Tomm,I'm guessing there's no point in putting a city next to a desert
Other,Dave,Not unless the other hexes are very likely to come up
Other,Tomm,:/
Other,Dave,7!
Other,Dave,I've laid out my things at the start really badly
Other,Tomm,:D
Other,rennoc1,"Sorry Rennoc, wanted your goods"
Other,Tomm,aargh! my precious ores
Other,Tomm,Delicious
Other,Dave,"It's okay Dave, so did I."
Other,Tomm,really
Other,Dave,oh...
Other,Tomm,reallllly
Other,Dave,Oh great. Sheep. Don't have any of those.
Other,Tomm,that was my favourite sheep!
Other,Tomm,Worrying... >.>
Other,rennoc1,"Sorry, what did you roll Rennoc?"
Other,Tomm,a 5 ( I think)
Other,Tomm,ORE! :D
Other,Dave,Also... you're all gonna hate me
Other,Dave,oh no
Other,rennoc1,"well, that wasn't too bad well, that wasn't too bad"
Other,Tomm,oh dear...
Other,Dave,"Sorry, need me some clay and I can't get it"
Offer,Tomm,wheat for ore anyone?
Refusal,Tomm,You just nicked my wheat :P
Refusal,Dave,Not going to buy it back
Offer,Dave,Want to buy it back? :D
Other,Dave,aw
Other,Tomm,discard?
Other,Dave,Well that was upsetting.
Other,Tomm,did you just lose four resources?
Other,Dave,yes
Other,rennoc1,how?
Other,Tomm,rolled a 7
Other,Dave,Had too many cards when a 7 came up
Other,Dave,"yeah, but"
Other,Dave,oh
Other,Tomm,didn't know that was a thing
Other,Tomm,I think it's over 7?
Other,Tomm,Anyway. Bah.
Other,Dave,My wheat!
Other,Tomm,I didn't want that wheat anyway
Offer,Tomm,Anyone want anything for wood?
Other,Dave,seeing as no one is rolling 8's despite it being really likely.
Other,rennoc1,equally likely for all numbers? Although I guess it depends on how the rolls are simulated
Refusal,Tomm,"dont have any, sorry"
Other,Tomm,Nah it isn't if it follows the proper game.
Other,Dave,"You are rolling 2 dice... so there are more ways of rolling say an 8, rather than a 2"
Other,Tomm,"Yeah, I mean if it's actually rolling two dice then there are more 8's tha- well, yeha"
"Offer, Other",Dave,So no wood anyone? okay okay
Refusal,Dave,"nope, sorry"
Other,Dave,10 10 10
Other,Dave,never a 10
Other,Dave,:9
Other,Tomm,*:(
Other,Dave,Yeah. Also 8 should be as likely as a 6... but looads of 6's no 8's :p
Other,Tomm,"also 7's, we've had about half the rolls as sevens"
Other,Tomm,7 is the most likely to be fair
Other,Dave,from what I remember
Other,rennoc1,"it is, yeah, even so"
"Offer, Other",Dave,so anyone have any ore? I have sheep to spare
Counteroffer,Tomm,I have wheat
Refusal,Dave,fraid not
Other,Dave,"more wheat, great"
Offer,Tomm,anyone need wheat?
"Refusal, Other",Dave,"Really not, sorry."
Offer,rennoc1,rennoc?
Refusal,Tomm,I'm fine for wheat at the mo
Other,Dave,well... sigh.
Other,Tomm,least you didn't have to lose half your resrouces this time
Other,Tomm,true.
Other,Dave,I'd rather like to roll an 8 though :P
Other,Tomm,No more wheat!
Other,Dave,Well thank you Rennoc :D
Offer,Tomm,anyone need wheat?
Counteroffer,Dave,What for?
Offer,Dave,"clay, I guess, or ore"
Offer,rennoc1,or wood
Other,Dave,"you know if you have more than 4, I think you can trade them into the bank,"
Other,Tomm,yeah but it's not ideal
Other,Tomm,That's true... 4 -> 1
Other,Tomm,"Well, I might do, but depends on my roll, I'm afraid"
Offer,Dave,Dave: Wheat for a clay?
Counteroffer,Tomm,"sure, can you do 2 for 2, or do you just want 1 for 1"
Accept,Dave,Just 1-4-1 I'm afraid
Accept,Tomm,fair enough
Other,Dave,Oh... now I get wheat(!)
Other,rennoc1,heh
Offer,Dave,any spare ores anyone?
Refusal,Tomm,"afraid not, sorry"
Refusal,Dave,None here either :(
Offer,Dave,wheat for wood anyone?
Offer,Tomm,or a sheep
Refusal,Dave,sorry :/
Other,Tomm,how do those resource tiles in the water work
Other,Dave,If you have a settlement on them you can get better trades
Other,Tomm,I thought that was the number ones
Other,Dave,the 3:1 means you can trade 3 of anything to 1 of anything
Other,Tomm,what about the other ones
Other,Dave,The resource ones -I think- mean you can trade 2 of any of that item to 1 of anything else
Other,Tomm,"ah, that's pretty good"
Other,rennoc1,But I might have that the wrong way around
Offer,Dave,anyone have any wood?
Refusal,Tomm,"nope, sorry"
Refusal,Tomm,I think we are all looking for it! I think we are all looking for it!
Other,Dave,Oh.
Offer,Dave,can anyone trade clay for ore
Offer,Tomm,"as in, I give you the clay"
Refusal,rennoc1,"No ore, sorry."
Refusal,Dave,me neither me neither
Other,Dave,good roll that
Other,Tomm,thanks
Other,Dave,"Sorry, boss walked in"
Other,Tomm,np
Other,Tomm,"Yes, that was a good roll for you."
Other,Dave,Ah. Sheep.
Other,Tomm,You basically control the sheep
Other,Tomm,That's not as handy or as sinister as it sounds
Other,Dave,Unfortunately.
Other,Tomm,Still cooler than being a wheat baron
Other,Dave,"I don't know, you've got 'baron' right there in the title"
Other,Tomm,That is actually the only good thing about this job
Other,Dave,Thank god. I was going to scream if I rolled a 7
Other,Tomm,haha
Other,Dave,Woo! Clay! Hard-earned clay!
Offer,Dave,anyone got clay or ore they can swap for wheat?
Offer,Tomm,"clay or wood, rather"
Accept,Dave,Only got that one
Offer,Dave,"could you, by any chance, use some fine high quality wheat"
Offer,Tomm,guaranteed to be 100% more edible than clay
"Accept, Other",Tomm,"If I get more clay, perhaps... I can eat the sheep for now."
Other,rennoc1,Cook them in my lovely new tandoor oven I made out of the clay!
"Counteroffer, Accept",Dave,maybe but I have almost nothing but wheat to trade back
Offer,Dave,clay or wood rennoc?
Offer,rennoc1,either one
Refusal,rennoc1,"unfortunately, neither one"
Counteroffer,Tomm,"tomm, could I give you 3 sheep for a clay and an ore?"
Refusal,Tomm,"I don't have ore, I'm afraid!"
Other,Tomm,Plus... I'm basically rolling in sheep
Other,rennoc1,"Really need to move that robber blocking your clay, eh? :/"
Other,Tomm,"but if I gave you some sheep, you could trade them back for the resources you'd need"
Refusal,rennoc1,"Well, as I say, don't have any ore at all"
Other,Tomm,"ok, cool."
Other,Tomm,I think Dave is the only one who does
Other,rennoc1,*whispers*horder!
Counteroffer,Dave,"do you have any ores, dave?"
Refusal,Dave,lo
Refusal,Dave,"I don't, no"
Offer,Dave,I have wheat
Other,Dave,wheat
Other,Dave,I stole your wheat
Other,Tomm,"aand, I didn't mean to end that"
Other,Dave,"Wait, who'd you steam from?"
Other,Dave,rennoc
Other,rennoc1,wwait
Other,Dave,so i see. i am now utterly wheatless
Other,Tomm,maybe you?
Other,Tomm,"Oh, that's harsh."
Other,Dave,one sec
Other,Dave,"nah, it was rennoc"
Other,Dave,"hey, I know where you can get some good wheat"
Offer,Tomm,"but seriously, want to trade for some wheat?"
Other,Dave,where goes the robber?
Other,Tomm,hasn't been moved yet
Other,Tomm,"bah, phone, brb."
Other,Tomm,Hey!
Other,Dave,:p
Other,Dave,heh
Other,Dave,...
Other,Dave,noooo
Other,rennoc1,I just bought the wrong resource
Offer,Dave,so you have ore to spare then...?
Accept,Dave,I do
Counteroffer,rennoc1,ore for wood?
"Counteroffer, Refusal",Dave,if only... I have clay? I have clay?
Other,Dave,that is more useful
Accept,Tomm,"yeah, go ahead yeah, go ahead"
Other,Tomm,"Sorry, back"
Other,Dave,what did I miss?
Other,Dave,not much
Other,Dave,ADDTIME
Other,Tomm,"we play this to the end, not until the time runs out, yeah?"
Other,Tomm,"yeah, we'll see"
Other,rennoc1,"Right, anyway... so I have bugger all... annnnd... yes."
Offer,Tomm,"so dave, what did you have to trade for clay?"
Other,Tomm,I covert rennoc's clay.
Counteroffer,Dave,I could offer things?
Counteroffer,Tomm,wood?
Counteroffer,Dave,Ore?
Counteroffer,Dave,clay rennoc
Counteroffer,rennoc1,"I have ore to trade (or wheat, always wheat) I have ore to trade (or wheat, always wheat)"
Offer,Tomm,"tomm, do you have ore?"
Accept,rennoc1,"Yes, yes I do"
Accept,Tomm,ok
Other,Tomm,8!
Other,Tomm,8!
Other,Dave,Not 8.
Offer,rennoc1,any wood around?
Refusal,Tomm,nope
Other,Tomm,Damn robber. He stole my sheep
Other,Dave,Woo! Poor!
Offer,Tomm,"has anyone got a sheep, I can trade wheat or clay"
Refusal,Dave,Surprisingly I am bereft of sheep.
Other,Dave,:(
Offer,rennoc1,rennoc?
Refusal,rennoc1,"sorry, no sheep"
Other,Tomm,brb
Offer,Dave,Fancy some tasty ore?
Refusal,Tomm,I do not ^_^
Other,Tomm,But... you can... you know... smelt it?
Offer,Dave,How about clay?
"Refusal, Other",Tomm,"nope, sorry, I'm good for clay"
Other,Dave,For... you know... sculpture?
Other,Tomm,and pots
Other,Dave,Bah. Philistine :P
Other,Dave,"hey, the people of Davetopia make very nice pots"
Other,Dave,"ooh, wood"
Offer,rennoc1,trade?
Other,Tomm,ok im back
Other,Dave,"Oh, so now Davetopia makes with the niceties?"
Other,Tomm,we are a fickle people
Other,Dave,Where was all this decorum when we talked before?
Other,Tomm,well you didn't have wood then
Other,Tomm,Snigger.
"Counteroffer, Other",Dave,"Tommville is amused by such base humour. Anyway, what will you offer for wood?"
Offer,Dave,wheat?:D
Offer,rennoc1,or clay
Counteroffer,Tomm,anone have sheep
Refusal,Tomm,"Pfft, your pots are of no use."
Refusal,Dave,Sadly still no sheep :(
Offer,Tomm,wheat then?
"Refusal, Other",rennoc1,"Talk to rennoc first, it's his go :p"
Accept,Dave,"yeah sure, could do with some wheat yeah sure, could do with some wheat"
Offer,Tomm,got wood?
Other,rennoc1,Still snigger.
Refusal,Dave,nope
Other,Dave,heh
Other,Tomm,"that's all I'm interested in, sorry :("
Counteroffer,Dave,Dave - how many wheat would you give for 1 wood?
Offer,Tomm,I will give you one whole wheat
Counteroffer,rennoc1,I must demand 2.
Counteroffer,Tomm,i would give you 2 clay?
Other,Dave,For the good of my people you understand
Refusal,Dave,"I must refuse, on principle"
Other,Dave,"well, it depends"
Other,Tomm,we'll see
Other,Tomm,"Rennoc, full of clay I'm afraid."
Counteroffer,Tomm,"although I could offer you ore, Rennoc?"
Counteroffer,Dave,depending on what you have
Other,rennoc1,also if anyone rolls a seven I will never forgive them
Counteroffer,Tomm,well... I've got some really good quality clay.
Other,Tomm,"Ah... we'll see when we get around to me, can bid for the wood."
Other,Dave,You crafty gender non-specific pronoun!
Offer,Tomm,I can give you one wheat and ore for wood
Refusal,Tomm,Don't want ore.
Counteroffer,rennoc1,Rennoc what can you offer me for wood?
Counteroffer,Dave,how about 4 clay for 1 wood and 1 ore?
Other,Tomm,don't do it! it's a trap
Other,rennoc1,"Wow, you are clay tastic, eh?"
Other,Dave,"yep, I speak to you from a bath of clay!"
Other,Tomm,(make sure it's not the bath clay he gives you) (make sure it's not the bath clay he gives you)
Other,Tomm,eww. Fair point. Fresh clay if you please
Counteroffer,rennoc1,Dave... wood for a wheat?
Other,Dave,my bath has been demoted to a sink
Accept,Dave,sure
Other,Tomm,wrong player
Other,Dave,bah
Other,Tomm,thanks
Other,Tomm,No... thank you all!
Other,Dave,Tommville is now Tommopolis!
Other,Tomm,:O
Other,Dave,"Wow, nice roll Rennoc :D"
Other,Dave,"ok, rennoc, listen to me"
Other,Dave,don't give tomm wheat
Other,Dave,sorry tomm
Other,Tomm,but he can win the game if he gets wheat
Other,rennoc1,Aww. :(
Offer,Tomm,"can you give wheat to me, dave?"
Other,Dave,"Sadly, the man does have a point. Sadly, the man does have a point."
Other,rennoc1,"uh, I might get some on my turn, so maybe"
Counteroffer,Dave,for clay?
Refusal,rennoc1,"I'm good for clay, thanks"
Offer,Tomm,any one have sheep?
Other,Dave,"That's a fair point, I've not had sheep for ages. I've not had sheep for ages."
Other,Dave,3 sheep
Other,Tomm,really
Offer,Tomm,Rennoc... I have sheep now?
Offer,Dave,Got any wheat? :P
Refusal,Dave,nooooooo
Other,rennoc1,"don't give him wheat, also, if you get the robber put it on that wheat tile in the middle"
"Counteroffer, Refusal",Tomm,nope sorry. I could spare some clay though
Counteroffer,rennoc1,1 clay for 1 sheep?
Accept,Tomm,thanks
Other,Dave,muhaha!
Other,rennoc1,uh no
Other,Dave,we're doomed
Other,Tomm,that got you less points than I thought
Other,Dave,"Settlement is worth 2, city 3"
Offer,rennoc1,anyone got wood or sheep to trade?
"Counteroffer, Other",Dave,"well, I am going to have to go in 5-10 mins, so before I do does anyone want any of my resources"
Other,Tomm,you have to go?
Other,rennoc1,I'm confused... I think I should have won?
Other,Dave,"unfortunately, yes."
Other,rennoc1,I'll add time shall I? We can always end it when we want anyway
Other,rennoc1,if we dont add time i could play till then though!
Other,Dave,or that.
Offer,rennoc1,do you have any wood or sheep rennoc?
Accept,Dave,both
Offer,rennoc1,1 ore and 1 wheat for 1 wood and 1 sheep? 1 ore and 1 wheat for 1 wood and 1 sheep?
Counteroffer,Dave,how about this.
Other,Dave,addtime
Refusal,rennoc1,don't have 2 wheat
Other,Dave,oh
Other,Tomm,would have offered it otherwise
Other,Dave,"bugger, I can't add up, that's why."
Other,Tomm,heh
Other,Dave,?
Other,rennoc1,"rennoc, you there?"
"Counteroffer, Other",Dave,"I really need to head off, what do you need guys? i have 5 clay, 1 ore, 2 sheep, 1 wood."
Offer,rennoc1,"sheep, wood"
Other,rennoc1,sorry for cutting things short on my part
Counteroffer,Tomm,how about you tomm?
Counteroffer,rennoc1,Feel free to fire me the clay
Counteroffer,Dave,ok it turns out you have to give me something in a trade
Counteroffer,rennoc1,a clay?
Counteroffer,Tomm,have anything you can spare for the trade tomm?
Refusal,rennoc1,"not realy, just ditch it"
Other,Tomm,"ok , thanks guys and good luck!"
Other,Dave,"cheers, was good playing!"
Other,Dave,so what happens if he quits?
Other,Markus,will the game remove him?
Other,Tomm,You two just continue
Other,Tomm,press done on his go :P
Other,Tomm,lets finish this up!
Other,Dave,SHEEP!
Other,Dave,null needs to discard?
Other,Tomm,I'm guessing that's rennoc
Other,Dave,Oh... I can't move the robber?
Other,Tomm,you've moved it already?
Other,Dave,"No, that was for a soldier card"
Other,Dave,oh
Other,Dave,"it says null needs to discard, I think it's a bug"
Other,Markus,it's still counting rennoc as having over 7 resources
Other,Tomm,Does it work now?
Other,Dave,"yes, fixed"
Other,Dave,wwwhat
Other,Dave,"oh, right"
Other,Tomm,^_^
Other,Dave,Woo! Settlement!
Other,Dave,"ha, congrats"
Other,Tomm,good game
Other,Tomm,"Hehe, it was fun, thanks."
Other,Dave,I think I got very lucky getting to the sheep port
Other,Tomm,"I spent far too long at the start building pointless roads, I wasn't 100% sure where I could build s"
Other,Dave,24 sheep :o
Other,Tomm,haha
Other,Tomm,"Yeah, that is a problem... Rennoc had lost about half way through to be honest"
Other,Tomm,I sort of cut him out >.>
Other,Dave,and ore is more important in the later game too
Other,Dave,"Yeah, I noticed, he couldn't really expand"
Other,Tomm,"I had just managed to take a wheat port, which would have been very helpful"
Other,Tomm,Yes!
Other,Tomm,Ports are great if you get them
Other,Markus,"Anyway, was a pleasure, should do it again sometime, outside of the experiment!"
Other,Dave,Thanks for participating.
Other,Markus,"Yeah, it's a good game"
Other,Markus,Glad you enjoyed it.

Other,ljaybrad123,lol I don't blame you/....
Other,gotwood4sheep,I'm very tempted because its incredibly sore
Other,gotwood4sheep,I'd take some pictures and make sure a report is filed so you have something to work with
Other,ljaybrad123,if you don't deal with the evidence now it'll be tough
Other,gotwood4sheep,I can't take pictures....
Other,gotwood4sheep,and if you're self employed you've gotta protect your income
Other,gotwood4sheep,the report and/or questions of liability are most important
Other,gotwood4sheep,maybe a trip to the doctors as well in that case
Other,ljaybrad123,?
Other,gotwood4sheep,yeah I went to docs
Other,gotwood4sheep,well at least that's on file.
Other,gotwood4sheep,I'd send the workplace a message checking they've filed an accident report
Other,ljaybrad123,and saying you're considering your options
Other,gotwood4sheep,bad bruising but pretty sure it's not broken
Other,gotwood4sheep,at least you give them notice
Other,ljaybrad123,hope so :( hope so :(
Other,gotwood4sheep,I told them i needed a report yesterday
Other,gotwood4sheep,"good.  well, good luck."
Other,ljaybrad123,"it sucks and it's stressful, and doing it when you feel bad blows"

Other,gotwood4sheep,yeah I just feel naff - and now cant work today or tomorrow at least
Other,ljaybrad123,:(
Other,ljaybrad123,maybe longer...
Other,gotwood4sheep,I can't lift any of the kids atm so i cant work
Other,ljaybrad123,I'd definitely cost up lost earnings and try and get a settlement
"Offer, Other",gotwood4sheep,yeah - it's just kinda like is it worth all the hassle for £70
Other,ljaybrad123,/incidental settlers pun
Other,gotwood4sheep,:)
Other,gotwood4sheep,You might find they're sweating it and if you asked for £70 they'd say sure
Other,ljaybrad123,settling works for all
Other,ljaybrad123,hmmm
Other,gotwood4sheep,I get the distinct feeling they dont really care
Other,gotwood4sheep,they'll care more if they think you're pursuing legal action
Other,ljaybrad123,"if they really don't, default judgement, bang"
Other,gotwood4sheep,yeah I suppose yeah I suppose
Other,gotwood4sheep,"I'd suggest a price, if they don't respond, small claims and see"
Other,ljaybrad123,sounds like there's a case to be heard
Other,gotwood4sheep,hmmm fair point

Other,Gaeilgeoir,if we're allowed to
Other,inca,"unfortunately, I won't be able."
Other,Gaeilgeoir,ah
Other,inca,"But if you want to do so, please go ahead. As I said, I don't mind at this stage"
Other,Gaeilgeoir,"well it would be a shame to exclude you, since you showed up today and all"
Other,inca,"ah god, I'd be online anyway, trust me."
Other,Gaeilgeoir,to be honest i think the fairest thing would be for us to play it now without him
Other,Gaeilgeoir,I have six windows open at once here
Other,Gaeilgeoir,"well, we can start."
Other,inca,"if he comes, we can restart."
Other,inca,"yep, that sounds fair yep, that sounds fair"

Other,dmm,i'm feeling rather behind now...
Other,gotwood4sheep,8s and 9s aren't as common as i'd hoped!
Other,gotwood4sheep,10s are not plentiful
Other,gotwood4sheep,8s have been common as they get
Other,gotwood4sheep,booo
Other,dmm,i stole from the wrong guy ;)
Offer,gotwood4sheep,any clay?
Refusal,gotwood4sheep,none still
Other,CheshireCatGrin,need to see a T
Refusal,gotwood4sheep,likewise likewise
Other,dmm,then i'll let you know you can rob me
Other,dmm,hmm i don't think there's anything else i can use right now... oh well
Other,gotwood4sheep,ooh i'm a bit scared of those 2 soldiers+2 dev cards
Other,gotwood4sheep,there goes 1
Other,dmm,needed to thieve
Other,dmm,aha so there wasn't a soldier among them ;) aha so there wasn't a soldier among them ;)
Other,gotwood4sheep,i haven't been paying attention... any tens yet?
Other,gotwood4sheep,still not one
Other,dmm,"how many rolls, 30?"
Other,gotwood4sheep,okey doke
Other,gotwood4sheep,maybe 24?
Other,dmm,ludicrous
Other,gotwood4sheep,for some reason i often find 10s are much rarer than they should be
Other,dmm,as rare as 4s ;)
Other,gotwood4sheep,that's how it should be! but 4s always seem to come up more often in my experience but 4s always seem to come up more often in my experience
Other,dmm,they have this game :D
Other,gotwood4sheep,why can't real life obey the rules of maths
Other,gotwood4sheep,our sample size is small ;)
Other,gotwood4sheep,also you keep thieving me
Other,gotwood4sheep,4 nooo
Other,dmm,i will cut youooo
Other,gotwood4sheep,sorry about that - i can't help feeling like you'll win at any moment ;)
Other,dmm,ahh soldier 7
Other,gotwood4sheep,"ah see, now you have 6! i was right to be aggressive"
Other,gotwood4sheep,how that rules
Other,CheshireCatGrin,i didn't want to deploy that soldier so soon >:( i didn't want to deploy that soldier so soon >:(
Offer,gotwood4sheep,any chanve anyone wants a sheep in return for wheat?
Refusal,dmm,no ta
Refusal,gotwood4sheep,i have literally nothing to give

Other,gotwood4sheep,gg all
Other,dmm,got a run of VP cards
Other,inca,ouch
Other,CheshireCatGrin,congrats niko!
Other,dmm,Well done :)
Other,gotwood4sheep,well done
Other,gotwood4sheep,ta guys ta guys
Other,gotwood4sheep,lucky run of 5s at the start
Other,gotwood4sheep,meant i could build cities earlier
Other,dmm,and buy cards to win
Other,gotwood4sheep,5s weren't so lucky for me :'(
Other,gotwood4sheep,jammy really
Other,gotwood4sheep,so that game: no 10s
Other,gotwood4sheep,at all
Other,dmm,that's one for the statisticians
Other,inca,haha
Other,gotwood4sheep,yeah that's bizarre
Other,dmm,"17 rounds, 51 rolls"
Other,gotwood4sheep,"well, looks like i'll be seeing you all next season! well, looks like i'll be seeing you all next season! well, looks like i'll be seeing you all next season!"
Other,gotwood4sheep,"we should have seen 6/36, or about 8/51 10s"
Other,gotwood4sheep,"yep, afraid LJ gets relegated unless there's less demand"
Other,gotwood4sheep,it was a much more balanced season
Other,CheshireCatGrin,1 win each to the end
Other,dmm,"Indeed, and I've enjoyed the season. But must dash! Bye!"
Other,dmm,yep
Other,inca,bye!
Other,dmm,"see you later matt, cheers for all your commitment"
Other,inca,i think i'll get going too i think i'll get going too
Other,dmm,and the rest of you and the rest of you
Other,gotwood4sheep,until next time!
Other,inca,inca you finished 2nd on VPs
Other,inca,see you :)
Other,gotwood4sheep,"haha, seriuosly?"
Other,inca,yup
Other,gotwood4sheep,interesting turn of events
Other,inca,I've been keeping count on my laptop to check for win conditions
Other,gotwood4sheep,i thought i was heading for dead last until last game
Other,gotwood4sheep,"since dmm got 3 and matt 5, it finished"
Other,gotwood4sheep,"me on 34, you 25, matt 24, duncan 22"
Other,inca,congrats ;)
Other,gotwood4sheep,cool! well i'm dead pleased with that
Other,gotwood4sheep,if you'd had one more game I reckon you'd have hit stride
Other,inca,did you read the blog?
Other,gotwood4sheep,cheers! and congrats on defending the title and congrats on defending the title
Other,inca,ta :D
Other,gotwood4sheep,"heh i did have a read through it, wonder if that helped"
Other,inca,"good blog, interesting"
Other,gotwood4sheep,was surprised at some of the relative values of resources
Other,gotwood4sheep,this game has some hidden complexity
Other,inca,indeed yes
Other,gotwood4sheep,i always saw clay as vital but they rate it as the least vital
Other,gotwood4sheep,so it is
Other,gotwood4sheep,the longest road is easiest to compete
Other,gotwood4sheep,and settlements lose value
Other,gotwood4sheep,ore/wheat ftw
Other,gotwood4sheep,I underrated sheep for a while
Other,gotwood4sheep,but they are great for card wins
Other,gotwood4sheep,"I must rush and walk the dog, we should chat more soon! Hopefully another season is round the corne"
Other,inca,corner*
Other,inca,"ok, was nice 'meeting' you!"
Other,gotwood4sheep,hoepfully see you again nex time
Other,inca,"indeed, you too!"
Other,inca,see you later :)
Other,intemporaliter,x
Other,keyser84,Hello?
Other,keyser84,hi
Other,intemporaliter,i actually tried to figure out how to add AI players to the game....
Other,intemporaliter,Figured I should check out how the interface works...
Other,intemporaliter,Initially I got a message saying 'this server has no bots' (possibly paraphrased...)
Other,keyser84,Place your first settlement?
Other,intemporaliter,"yes, I know"
Other,keyser84,Sorry.
Other,keyser84,but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood
Other,intemporaliter,"sry, I should be faster"
Other,keyser84,No hurry :-)
Other,intemporaliter,"ok, now vice versa, so me again"
Other,intemporaliter,Aye.
Other,keyser84,"Possibly not my greatest ever play, but my other choice was between your two settlements ."
Other,intemporaliter,"yes, so now who rolls the dice?"
Other,keyser84,"It seems to have rolled for me (or at least, I didn't get the option to hit 'roll'..."
Other,intemporaliter,"yes, game log says it... displays only 2 lines of text in my case"
Other,intemporaliter,Yup. Same. Didn't notice at first.
Offer,keyser84,Are you at all interested in trading a sheep for a brick (if you have one)?
"Refusal, Other",intemporaliter,"no, have no brick"
Other,keyser84,"Fair, I wasn't sure."
Other,intemporaliter,"ok, so trade is my only option"
Other,keyser84,That must be how it shows robber movement.
Other,keyser84,"yes, that was my point"
Other,keyser84,i meant for wood
Other,intemporaliter,"ok, but wait, why there is a contour robber on wood-2"
Other,keyser84,"I don't know, bug? bug?"
Other,keyser84,and the grey one on clay-9
Other,intemporaliter,hmmm
Other,keyser84,"I moved it there with the 7, then onto the brick with a soldier..."
Other,keyser84,"anyway, then i have at least the low possibility of getting wood"
Other,intemporaliter,"ah, I see"
Other,intemporaliter,I was nicer that time - nothing is totally blocked now.
Other,keyser84,looks like it shows you a shadow of the last placing of the robber...
Other,intemporaliter,yes
Other,keyser84,It would be nice to be able to buy something other than development cards...
Other,keyser84,ok
Offer,intemporaliter,"want to trade? I give 1 wheat, you give 1 sheep"
"Counteroffer, Refusal",keyser84,"If you get any clay, I will happily trade. Don't currently need wheat though."
Other,keyser84,"no, then not then not"
Offer,intemporaliter,"i give 2 wheat, you give 1 sheep?"
Accept,keyser84,Okay
Offer,intemporaliter,again 2 wheat for 1 sheep?
"Refusal, Other",keyser84,"I'm out of sheep, I'm afraid - swapped them for clay."
Other,intemporaliter,"ah, ok"
Offer,keyser84,Don't suppose you'd be interested in ore for clay?
Accept,intemporaliter,"ok, why not"
Other,keyser84,Thank you.
Offer,intemporaliter,you can give sheep for wheat?
Other,intemporaliter,"Is your points counter showing you 4 or 6? Yours is showing me 4, but you should have longest road?"
"Refusal, Other",keyser84,I wish I had sheep. Need to roll a 4!
Other,keyser84,"4 points, longest road i think only from 5 roads or longer"
Other,intemporaliter,as far as i remember the rules
Other,keyser84,"Sounds right now. Was getting mixed up with army, which is only 3."
Other,keyser84,"ah, yes"
Other,keyser84,i was lucky to get directly the 7
Other,intemporaliter,"ok, 3 times 7 in a row"
Other,intemporaliter,As was I. Odd steak...
Other,keyser84,/streak
Offer,intemporaliter,"trade? i give 1 ore, receive 1 wood/wheat"
Counteroffer,keyser84,I'll give you a wood for 2 ore?
Accept,keyser84,ok
Offer,intemporaliter,"trade? i give 2 ore, receive 2 wheat"
Accept,intemporaliter,Okay
Other,keyser84,Apologies for the delay. Employment agency call. Back now.
Other,intemporaliter,no problem
Offer,keyser84,Do you have any spare wheat? I've ore or sheep on offer.
Accept,intemporaliter,"ok, 1 wheat for 1 sheep"
Other,keyser84,Ok
Offer,keyser84,i give 2 ore for 1 clay/wheat
Offer,intemporaliter,ok?
Refusal,keyser84,"I have no clay or wheat, I'm afraid :-("
Other,intemporaliter,ok
Other,keyser84,If the robber were to leave my clay :-) If the robber were to leave my clay :-)
Other,intemporaliter,"sry, has to go there :-)"
Offer,keyser84,Do you have any wheat or sheep for ore or wood?
Counteroffer,intemporaliter,can you give 2 wood for 1 sheep
Counteroffer,keyser84,Would give 3 wood for a sheep and a wheat?
Refusal,intemporaliter,"sry, have no wheat"
Accept,keyser84,"Okay, will do 2 wood for a sheep."
Other,keyser84,"ok, fine"
Other,intemporaliter,congrats!
Other,keyser84,Thank you. I got just the right development card there. I got just the right development card there.
Other,intemporaliter,"quite nice, but the interface could be better"
Other,keyser84,Odd playing this two player. Happier with the interface now though.
Other,keyser84,yes
Other,keyser84,"ok, i'll leave then"
Other,intemporaliter,cu
